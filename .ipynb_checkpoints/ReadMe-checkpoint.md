# üß† Mental Health Prediction Based on Survey Responses

This project predicts whether an individual might experience mental health issues at work, based on responses from a publicly available mental health survey. We built a classification model using a Random Forest Classifier, achieving a test accuracy of over 85%.

## üìä Dataset Overview

- Source: Open mental health in tech industry survey
- Target: `treatment` (whether the individual has sought treatment for mental health)

### üßæ Features include:
- Age, Gender, Country, State
- Family history of mental illness
- Remote work, company size, benefits
- Attitude towards mental health at workplace
- Work interference, supervisor support, etc.

## ‚öôÔ∏è ML Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Filled missing values using `.fillna()` (mean for numerical, "unknown" for categorical)
   - Dropped excessive NaNs initially (consider using `SimpleImputer` instead to avoid data loss)

2. **Encoding**
   - Categorical columns were label encoded using `LabelEncoder()`

3. **Standardization**
   - StandardScaler used to normalize feature distributions

4. **Model**
   - `RandomForestClassifier` from `sklearn.ensemble`
   - Trained on 90% of data, tested on 10%
